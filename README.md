# Hive Engine

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/josephroqueca/hive-engine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/josephroqueca/hive-engine) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/josephroqueca/hive-engine/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/josephroqueca/hive-engine)

Manages the game state of a game of hive and determines valid playable moves.

Additionally, produces new game states from the application of valid moves.

## Usage

You can read about each of the engine's components below, or dive right in with an instance of `GameState`:

```
let state = GameState()
```

### Unit

A `Unit` represents one of the various pieces a game of Hive is played with -- ants, spiders, etc.

Each `Unit` has a `class`, which defines the type of bug it is, an `owner` to let you know who it belongs to, and an `identifier` to differentiate each instance.

There are a variety of functions for determining if a `Unit` can move, and where it can move to.

Each class of `Unit` also provides an extension to the `Unit` class to calculate its moves. See extension classes such as `Unit+Ant` and `Unit+Beetle` for more.

### Position

A `Position` is a space on the "board" where a `Unit` can be placed or moved to.

`Position`s rely on a hexagonal grid system, inspired by an [excellent article](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) by Red Blog Games. Details on the grid system implementation can be found [here](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/implementation.html).

The `Position` class also provides functions for determining if a `Unit` can move freely between two `Positions`, very important for determining valid moves in the current state.

### Movement

A `Movement` provides details on moving a `Unit` around the board, or introducing a new `Unit` to the board.

* `.move(unit:to:)` specifies instructions for moving a `Unit` to a `Position`
* `.place(unit:at:)` specifies instructions for placing a `Unit` at a `Position`
* `.yoink(pillBug:unit:to:)` specifies instructions for moving a `Unit` through the use of a Pill Bug to a `Position`

### GameState

The `GameState` is the structure which manages the overall state of a game of Hive.

Get started by creating an instance: `let state = GameState()`

You can enumerate all the current moves available with `availableMoves` and `opponentMoves`.

To update the `GameState` with a given move, call `apply(_:)` which will mutate the state in place. If you want to explore various `Movement`s, you can undo a move with `undoMove()`

For better performance, you can disable move validation with `requireMovementValidation = false`.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

This package is built with Swift Package Manager, so you can require it as a dependency in your `Package.swift` file:

```
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "git@github.com:josephroqueca/hive-engine.git", .branch("master"))
    ],
```

Optionally, you can lock the engine to a specific version with:

```
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "git@github.com:josephroqueca/hive-engine.git", from: "1.0.0")
    ],
```

See the [Releases](https://github.com/josephroqueca/hive-engine/releases) for the most recent release.

### Manual

To install manually, simply drag and drop `HiveMind.xcodeproj` into your Xcode project.

### Requirements

* Swift 4.2+
